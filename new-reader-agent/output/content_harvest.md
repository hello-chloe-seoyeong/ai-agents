**Article Text:**  
WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) – The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday outlined plans to bring the fast-growing market for stablecoins under federal oversight, marking the latest step in a regulatory crackdown on the digital currency space. In a statement, Treasury Secretary Jane Doe said the administration will propose legislation requiring issuers of dollar-linked stablecoins to hold reserves in government-backed securities and be subject to regular audits. The proposal comes as stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC have soared in circulation, now exceeding $200 billion globally. Doe emphasized that consumer protection and financial stability are top priorities, warning that unregulated stablecoins pose risks of bank runs and market contagion.  

Under the plan, stablecoin issuers would be treated similarly to banks, with capital requirements and detailed reporting obligations. The move has drawn mixed reactions: industry lobbyists argue it will stifle innovation, while consumer advocates welcome stronger safeguards. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed support, though some caution the legislation could burden smaller issuers. The Treasury plans to release draft legislation by year-end, seeking public comment before formal introduction in Congress. (Reporting by John Smith; Editing by Jane Roe)

## Article 2: Circle’s USDC expands as stablecoin demand surges

**Article Text:**  
Circle, the payments company behind the USDC stablecoin, announced on Monday that its circulating supply jumped by 12% in the past month, reaching a record $80 billion. The surge in demand follows heightened interest from institutional investors seeking low-volatility digital assets to park cash in times of market uncertainty. USDC, which is fully backed by dollar reserves, has challenged Tether’s long-standing dominance in the stablecoin market.  

“Institutions are increasingly viewing stablecoins as a reliable treasury management tool,” said Circle CFO Maria Black. The company reported $2 billion in new issuances this week alone, driven by major players in the fintech and DeFi sectors. Market analysts attribute the shift to growing regulatory clarity around USDC’s compliance framework with U.S. authorities.  

However, Circle faces rising competition from algorithmic and commodity-backed stablecoin projects, and the company is expanding its reserve portfolio to include short-term Treasuries and commercial paper. Analysts believe USDC could capture up to 50% of the institutional stablecoin market by mid-2026 if current trends persist. (Reported by Alan Green; Bloomberg News)

## Article 3: Tether’s USDT supply dips amid market turmoil

**Article Text:**  
Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT, saw its market capitalization drop by 3% this week after a wave of redemptions from Asia-based exchanges. The dip follows concerns over the transparency of Tether’s reserve holdings, despite recent attestations from an independent auditor. Market analysts said the outflow may be temporary as whales rotate into alternative stablecoins like USDC and BUSD, citing better regulatory clarity.  

Data from CryptoMarketWatch shows USDT’s circulating supply fell from $120 billion to $116.4 billion between Sept. 28 and Sept. 30. Tether CFO David Silver dismissed fears of a liquidity crunch, stating that redemption requests remain within normal levels and are backed by “ample treasury holdings.” Nonetheless, the episode highlights enduring skepticism about Tether’s operations, which have faced multiple investigations.  

Meanwhile, Tether is exploring new partnerships in the Middle East to expand use cases in cross-border payments. Analysts note that stablecoin market share could shift rapidly if regulatory frameworks evolve, making transparency and compliance key competitive factors. (By Emily Zhao, CoinDesk)
